    <p>This native dog breed is also called Desi Dog, Desi Kutta, Indian Feral Dog, Indian Pariah 
        Dog, Indian Pye Dog, Street dog breed as well as South Asian Pariah Dog and also called 
        as mixed breed, mutt or an indie dog. The most common dog breed found in India. </p>
    <q><i>Pariah</i> means an outcast – a more misfitting travesty — unlike all other exotic 
        breeds, these dogs are native to the Indian subcontinent and make an excellent pet 
        or guard dog. </Q>
    <ul>
        <li>These dogs have never been selectively bred, their appearance, physical features and 
            mental characteristics are created by the process of natural selection alone.</li>
        <li>In addition, they have lost none of the natural intelligence of the natural dog, 
            and are thus capable of reasoning just like wild wolves, jackals and foxes. </li>
       <li> Being very intelligent, they are easy to train, but being independent thinkers, 
        they are not very biddable (unlike German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers and Border Collies, for example),
         and do not like dull, repetitive ‘obedience’ exercises. </li>
       <li>They are extremely agile and better climbers than most developed European breeds, 
        and have a fondness for climbing on to high places, such as the tops of brick walls, 
        raised platforms,etc.</li>
    </ul>
